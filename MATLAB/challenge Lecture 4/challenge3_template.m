% CODE CHALLENGE 3 - Calculate mean and standard deviation and plot error
%                    bars from two data sets
%
% The purpose of this program is to assess whether two data sets are the
% same.
%
% To complete the challenge, finish the code below to:
% 1) load csv file
% 2) calculate mean and standard deviation of data set
% 3) plot mean with standard deviation error bars
% 4) set axes to set data points in center of plot
% 5) correctly label axes, title, and legend
%
% Please ZIP and upload the 'func.txt', your team's script(s), and the
% results file to Canvas to complete the challenge.

%% Housekeeping: Clear the variables and close all open plots
   % Clears all the variables
   % Closes all the plots
   % Clears the command line
%% Initialization: Define the Functions, Load Data, and Set Known Values

% load data using csvread (data file format). Start at row 2 and read all
% columns.


%% Calculate mean and standard deviations for each subject
%
% calculate mean

% calculate standard deviation


%% Plotting: Plot subject data with error bars
%
% plot mean as a point, and standard deviation error bars
% use 'errobar' function to create bars


% set x-axes limits so that points show up in center of plot


% label axes, title, and legend


% save file as '.png' type. Use 'saveas' function
