Remember that there is a [reference guide](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference) linked on Canvas on writing math in Markdown. **All** of your written commentary, justifications and mathematical work should be in Markdown.\n",
    "- Because you can technically evaluate notebook cells is a non-linear order, it's a good idea to do Kernel $\\rightarrow$ Restart & Run All as a check before submitting your solutions.  That way if we need to run your code you will know that it will work as expected. \n",
    "- It is **bad form** to make your reader interpret numerical output from your code.  If a question asks you to compute some value from the data you should show your code output **AND** write a summary of the results in Markdown directly below your code. \n",
    "- 95 points of this assignment are in problems.  The remaining 5 are for neatness, style, and overall exposition of both code and text.\n",
    "- This probably goes without saying, but... For any question that asks you to calculate something, you **must show all work and justify your answers to receive credit**. Sparse or nonexistent work will receive sparse or nonexistent credit. \n",

The older passengers, however, had almost equal survivors and deaths meaning they were the most likely age group to survive. On the other hand, no one over 70 survived. This still does not indicate that older people were less likely to survive because this trend does not follow for the other older ages."

A density histogram, on the other hand, normalizes all the heights of the bins by the total area such that the area of all the bins equals 1.

    "The data mostly suggests male chivalry because women, regardless of class, always had a higher probability of survival. Younger/healthier people did not 'overpower' the elderly because, while there were more younger people who survived, there were also more younger passengers in general on the boat and more that did not survive. In other words, there was a greater probaility of survival given an older aged person (60-70) than a younger person (20-30). The calculations above also suggest that there was also no class war because there were more people in third class who survived than first class. There were also more people in third class in general. In order to take into account the populations of the classes, the probabilites should be normalized by their class size, or P(S and class 1)/P(class 1) = P(S|class 1) and so forth for class 3. This yields the result that there was an equal probability of survival regardless of first or third class as shown in the calculations below. This means there was no class war."

    "**P.S.** It is not a component of your graded assignment, but the 1997 James Cameron film _Titanic_ captured some of these very notions in some riveting cinema. Whether or not you found evidence for these cases in the data, you might find it interesting to watch the movie (or just the segments of the sinking) to see one interpretation of these ideas. You can perhaps see how we might be persuaded to reinterpret the evidence of data by a heart-wrenching performance from a handsome young Leonardo DiCaprio!"
